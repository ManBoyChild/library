***READ ME***

This project is going to solidfy my knowledge on JavaScript objects and different prototype inheritance. The project will also use more advanced CSS featrues than previous to help keep a clean and modern looking website.

The project is going to create a virtual library to keep track of multiple books which the user can add. The library will keep track of the title, author, pages, and if the user has/has not read it. The enrty form will be at the top and each book that is added will be displayed in its own card which contains all of the info stored. The user will also be able to delete books for the library and change if they have read the book or not.
